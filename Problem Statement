Problem Statement: Quantum Maze Solver Using Grover's Algorithm


Introduction;
  A quantum maze solver using Grover's Algorithm is designed to find the optimal path through a maze efficiently using quantum computation principles. This problem maps the classical problem of navigating a maze to a quantum search problem, where Grover’s algorithm helps in locating the correct path with quadratic speedup over classical methods.


Problem Definition;
  The objective is to use a quantum algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the goal as efficiently as possible.
  Given a maze represented as a graph
    Nodes represent positions within the maze.
    Edges represent valid paths between positions.
    One node is the start position.
    Another node is the goal position.
    Some paths are blocked, forming obstacles (walls of the maze).


Classical Approach vs Quantum Approach;
  
  Classical Search Methods:
    Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) explore paths systematically.
    Dijkstra’s Algorithm finds the shortest path efficiently but requires significant computational resources.
    A Search* improves efficiency with heuristics but can be computationally expensive for large mazes.

Quantum Approach with Grover's Algorithm:
  Grover’s algorithm provides a quadratic speedup in searching an unsorted database.
  We treat all possible paths as an unsorted database.
  The correct path is marked by an oracle function.
  The Grover search iteratively amplifies the probability of the correct path.


Quantum Representation of the Maze;
  State Representation:
    Each possible path in the maze is represented as a quantum state (qubit string).
    Example:
    |000⟩ → First path
    |001⟩ → Second path
    |010⟩ → Third path
    ...
    ...
    ...
    |111⟩ → Last path
    A superposition of all possible paths is created.
  
  Oracle Function:
    The oracle checks if a given path reaches the goal without hitting obstacles.
    If a path is valid, the oracle marks it by flipping its phase (|x⟩ → -|x⟩).

  Amplitude Amplification:
    Grover’s iteration amplifies the probability of correct paths.
    The process repeats ⌊√N⌋ times (where N is the number of paths) to maximize the likelihood of measuring the correct solution.


Text-Based Illustration;

  Example Maze Representation:
    Consider a 3×3 grid maze where:
      S is the start position.
      G is the goal position.
      # represents walls (blocked paths).
      . represents open paths.
              S . #
              . # .
              . . G

  Binary Encoding of Quantum Paths:
    Each possible Qubit path can be represented as a binary string:
      |000⟩ → Path 1 (invalid)
      |001⟩ → Path 2 (valid)
      |010⟩ → Path 3 (valid)
      ...
      ...
      ...
      |111⟩ → Path N (goal reached)
  The oracle marks |111⟩ as the correct path.
  Grover’s algorithm amplifies the probability of measuring |111⟩.
